Draw a Threat model based on asset centric apporach - STRIDE 
Theme: Any application as per your choice 

Refer: https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process

Sample: Threat Model: Web-Based Healthcare Management System
1. Identify Assets
Patient Data: Personal information, medical history, prescriptions.
User Authentication System: Login credentials, access tokens.
Medical Records Database: Storage of sensitive patient data.
Appointment Scheduling Module: Doctor-patient interactions.
Billing System: Payment details, invoices.
Healthcare APIs: Communication between different hospitals, pharmacies, and insurance providers.
2. Identify Threats using STRIDE
STRIDE Category	Threat Description	Affected Asset
Spoofing	Attackers impersonate doctors or patients by exploiting authentication vulnerabilities.	User Authentication System
Tampering	Unauthorized modification of medical records (e.g., altering prescriptions).	Medical Records Database
Repudiation	Patients deny making certain payments or scheduling appointments, creating accountability issues.	Billing System, Appointment Module
Information Disclosure	Sensitive patient data is exposed due to weak encryption or improper access controls.	Patient Data, Healthcare APIs
Denial of Service (DoS)	Attackers flood appointment booking services, making the system unavailable.	Appointment Scheduling Module
Elevation of Privilege	A low-privileged user (e.g., a receptionist) gains admin-level access.	User Authentication System, Database
3. Attack Vectors & Mitigation Strategies
Attack Vector	Possible Threats (STRIDE)	Mitigation
Brute Force Attack	Spoofing	Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and rate-limiting.
SQL Injection	Tampering, Information Disclosure	Use prepared statements, input validation.
Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack	Information Disclosure	Enforce HTTPS, use TLS encryption.
Session Hijacking	Elevation of Privilege, Spoofing	Implement secure cookie attributes, session expiration policies.
API Misuse/Abuse	Information Disclosure, Tampering	Implement API access control (OAuth, rate limiting, auditing).
DDoS on Scheduling System	Denial of Service	Use Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), implement rate limiting, and cloud-based DDoS protection.
4. Threat Model Diagram (Basic Structure)
A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) can be drawn with:

External Entities: Patients, Doctors, Admins.
Processes: Authentication, Appointment Scheduling, Record Management, Payment Processing.
Data Stores: Medical Database, Billing System.
Data Flows: API communications, user inputs.
Threat Indicators: Mark STRIDE threats at vulnerable points (e.g., Spoofing near authentication, DoS on booking module).
