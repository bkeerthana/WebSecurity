1. Write a script to log the current URL of the page using the window.location property. Extract and log any query parameters. Discuss how query parameters might be exploited in a phishing attack.

2. Write a script to log the hostname, protocol, and pathname of the current page using window.location. Explain how attackers might manipulate these properties to perform malicious redirects.

3.Write a script that uses window.location to redirect users to another webpage. Add a condition to restrict redirects only to trusted domains. Discuss the implications of open redirects in phishing attacks.

4. Write a script to log the number of pages visited in the current session using window.history. Discuss potential privacy concerns if malicious scripts attempt to track browser history.

5.Write a script using window.navigator to display the user agent string. Modify the script to identify and log whether the browser is Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or an automation tool.

6. Write a script to log the user's screen width and height using window.screen. Explain how attackers might use screen dimensions to craft phishing attacks.

7.Write a script to open a new popup window using window.open. Discuss the risks associated with popup-based attacks and suggest mitigation strategies.

8.Write a script to log the domain and origin of the current page using window.location. Explain how these properties are relevant in CORS security.

9.Write a script using window.setTimeout that simulates a login timeout after 10 seconds of inactivity. Enhance the script to reset the timer whenever the user interacts with the page.

10.Write a script that checks if the current URL uses "https" using window.location. Alert the user if the page is not secure and suggest measures to handle such scenarios.

11.Write a script to open a new window and then close it using window.close.
Discuss scenarios where malicious scripts might misuse this functionality to disrupt user experience.

12.Write a script to scroll the webpage to the top using window.scrollTo.
Modify the script to scroll to a specific element on the page.
Discuss how attackers might use scrolling to hide malicious content or overlays.

13. Write a script to retrieve the current webpage's title using document.title and log it to the console. Modify the title to include a security warning if it doesn't already contain "Secure." Explain how attackers might manipulate the document title for phishing or social engineering attacks.
